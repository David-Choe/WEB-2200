    <h3>Digital I/O</h3>
    <h4>Soldering</h4>

    <p>Working on soldering I was surprised how it went since this was my first time doing this kind of thing. I think that my soldering went well for the first half. I attempted to do the other side of the wire in order to make it easier to get into the breadboard but it didnâ€™t go well and I ended up cutting it off and using tin foil to get it into the breadboard.</p>

        <p>After soldering with help from Tinkercad I connected everything together. I also got some coding done in between to get some lighting controls done.</p>

        <p>For my creative enclosure, I wanted to make an effect where the LED would light up a skyscraper. So I sketched out the skyline and then boxed in the breadboard and Arduino. I then poked a hole through the top to put in a pencil to activate the different effects of the LED. The outcome was a box with a light that lighted up the tallest skyscraper drawn.</p>
