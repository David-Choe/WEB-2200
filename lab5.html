    <p>In the first part of this lab, things went fairly well. The only problem that I ran into was mistaking a different piece for the H-Bridge since they looked the same. Other than that things went smoothly the code was easy to understand.</p>

    <h4>Analog Input</h4>

        <p>For this second half of the lab adding the analog controller was more difficult than expected. Although coding the Arduino was not bad I ran into an issue where the dc motor would just refuse to do the analog changes sometimes. While I wanted to change the speed of the fan with the potentiometer it only like being in the max speed or off-state it refused to work in the in-between. So I switched to changing the direction of the fan which worked out well, but sometimes the motor just didn’t like switching and sometimes didn’t do it. In the end, I got it to work but I think there are some issues that still exist.</p>
