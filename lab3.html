    <p>For the first half of this project, the work was straightforward. Although I had some issues with coding it went well. With last week's Tinkercad I was able to set it up nicely without struggle.</p>

    <h4>Tone Output</h4>

        <p>For this part of the project it went well I just followed what the lab notes said and it worked out.</p>

        <p>For the last part I knew I wanted to do something new with my enclosure, so looking around my room I thought it would be interesting to use a glove. Initially, I wanted to use a motor and a pressure sensor to control a finger to move, but I procrastinated and that idea got scrapped. I ended up still using the glove and had the pressure sensor do something. </p>
