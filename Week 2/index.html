      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p> At the start of the game the player sets up the board. The board is made up of hexigonal pieces allowing the board
        to be randomize each playthrough. Once the board is made players go in order playing down their first settlements, these settlement will
        determine the resources that the player will get. Each hexigonal tile of the board will have number assoicated with it.
        When the dice is rolled the number will determine which resources a player will get. Player settlements placement is important
        as it will determine what resources will be avaible for the player. Seven is the only number in the game in which player will
        not get resources as it will allow the player to move a robber that can block certain tiles from giving resources. Players will continue to
        roll and gather resources and build settlements and road in order to win the game.</p>
