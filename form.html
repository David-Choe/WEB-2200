    <p id="fP1">For this first assignment, I wasn't really sure what to do until I remembered that I was a little annoyed at my pencil drawer. So I decided to make a box for all my pencils. This started with measuring out my longest pencil to make sure that I could fit everything in there. From that point the sketch was made in order to accomplish two things; fit all my stuff and be stackable in case I need more storage. I measured the height to make sure the box could fit and then it was smooth sailing. For the final part, I did add a divider in the middle of the box, although I'm not sure if ill keep it in the future. For my first CAD model, I'm pretty satisfied with my work.</p>
