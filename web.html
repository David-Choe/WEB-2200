    <p>This portfolio website was made as my final in my web design class. My goals for this project was to make a clean and professional-looking site and to have a solid Figma document. Making this site I hoped to showcase some of my coding ability as well as my some of my other works that I have done in my other classes. Making this site I started by looking at other sites for some insperation. From them I made a wireframe and style guide on Figma. From that point I slowy started to make the site.</p>
